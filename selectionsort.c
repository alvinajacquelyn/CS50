//This algorithm is called selection sort, and we might write pseudocode like this:
// For i from 0 to nâ€“1
//     Find smallest item between i'th item and last item
//     Swap smallest item with i'th item

//smallest element is exchanged with the first element of the unsorted list of elements
//(the exchanged element takes the place where smallest element is initially placed).
//then the second smallest element is exchanged with the second element of the unsorted list of elements and so on until all the elements are sorted

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Here i & j for loop counters,
    //temp for swapping,
    //count for total number of elements aka n,
    //number[] to store the input numbers in array.
    // You can increase or decrease the size of number array as per requirement

    int i, j , temp, count, number[30];
    printf("How many numbers are u going to enter?: ");
    scanf("%d",&count);

    for ( i=0; i< count; i ++) //loop to get elements sorted in array

            {
                temp = number[i];
                number[i] = number[j];
