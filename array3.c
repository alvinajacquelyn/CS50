In C, we have different types of variables we can use for storing data:
bool 1 byte
char 1 byte
int 4 bytes
float 4 bytes
long 8 bytes
double 8 bytes
string ? bytes
Each of these types take up a certain number of bytes per variable we create, and the sizes above are what the sandbox, IDE, and most likely your computer uses for each type in C.
