import re
from cs50 import get_string

s = get_string("Do you agree?\n")

if re.search("^y(es)?$", s, re.IGNORECASE):
    print("Agreed.")
elif re.search("^no?$", s, re.IGNORECASE):
    print("Not agreed.")

First, we need the re package, or library, for regular expressions.
Then, for y or yes, we have the regular expression ^y(es)?$. We want to make sure that the string starts with y, and optionally has es immediately after the y, and then ends.
Similarly, for n and no, we want our string to start, have the letter n, and optionally the letter o next, and then end. The regular expression for that would be ^no?$.
We pass in another argument, re.IGNORECASE, to ignore the casing of the letters in the string.
