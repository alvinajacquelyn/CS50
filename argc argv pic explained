argc is the integer variable which denotes the number of arguments given ,
where as the argv[ ] is the array of the strings which signify the various arguments strings.

Consider an Example -
Suppose after compiling the code ,we give the input via command line .

Just after the compilation we typed
./a.out 19 23 34 45
Then in that case - argc = 5 (no of strings including the ./a.out)
argv[0] = “./a.out”
argv[1] = “19” /* It is not a integer but a string*/
argv[2] = “23”
argv[3] = “34”
argv[4] = “45”

Generally we have to take the inputs as integers , so to convert the string input to integer is we use a function called atoi .
To use the atoi function we include the library stdlib.h (#include stdlib.h)
