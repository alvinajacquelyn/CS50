//First, we get a string s. Then, for each character in the string, if itâ€™s lowercase (its value is between that of a and z), we convert it to uppercase. Otherwise, we just print it.
//We can convert a lowercase letter to its uppercase equivalent, by subtracting the difference between their ASCII values.
//(We know that lowercase letters have a higher ASCII value than uppercase letters, and the difference is conveniently the same between the same letters, so we can subtract that difference to get an uppercase letter from a lowercase letter.)
